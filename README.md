# Kiwi: The Secure Agentic Control Plane

Kiwi is an enterprise-ready secure execution engine that runs autonomous developer loops (TDD Actor-Critic alignment) in the cloud while pulling required secrets dynamically and securely from the local machine over a reverse tunnel.

With Kiwi, you can trigger complex, long-running agent workflows in the cloud sandbox and **safely close your laptop**. If a step requires a developer credential (like a GitHub OAuth token, database credentials, or API keys), the execution statefully pauses, wait for you to reconnect, and resumes once the tunnel is active.

    participant CLI as Local CLI Client
    participant Server as Kiwi Cloud Daemon
    participant Sandbox as Cloud Sandbox (Temp Dir)

    CLI->>Server: 1. Pack & Sync Codebase (ZIP upload)
    Server->>Sandbox: 2. Extract Workspace
    Server->>Server: 3. Spawn Actor-Critic Loop
    CLI->>Server: 4. Open Reverse Tunnel stream (GET /tunnel/{id})
    
    loop Loop Execution
        Sandbox->>Server: Resolve Env Key (e.g. GITHUB_TOKEN)
        Server->>CLI: Request Secret Key over Tunnel
        Note over CLI: Fetch key from env / secrets.json
        CLI-->>Server: POST Secret Value (POST /tunnel/{id}/response)
        Server-->>Sandbox: Inject Credentials
        Sandbox->>Sandbox: Execute Test / Build commands
    end

    Note over CLI: Laptop Closed! (Tunnel Breaks)
    Server->>Server: Detect Disconnect & set Task State to "PAUSED"
    Server->>Server: Block loop execution thread

    Note over CLI: Laptop Opened! (Reconnected)
    CLI->>Server: Resume Task (kiwi -resume -task-id {id})
    Server->>Server: Set Task State back to "RUNNING"
    Server->>Server: Unblock thread & continue execution
```

## Core Features

1.  **Actor-Critic Alignment Loop**: A test-driven development (TDD) controller that iteratively edits code, evaluates compiler/test stdout in the sandbox, and refines fixes.
2.  **Reverse Credential Tunneling**: Eliminates the need to persist long-lived AWS, GitHub, or GCP API credentials on cloud sandbox hosts.
3.  **Headless Laptop Pause & Resume**: Complete offline resilience. Execution freezes statefully when a laptop disconnects and resumes when it reconnects.
4.  **Loop Safety & Budgeting**: Built-in protection gates:
    *   **Circuit Breaker**: Detects infinite recursive loop states by tracking duplicate compiler stdout patterns.
    *   **Budget Caps**: Sets strict cost controls per task (runs at simulated token pricing) to prevent budget drainage.
5.  **Interactive Kanban Dashboard**: Embedded dark-themed dashboard featuring status cards, live polling, log filters, and a real-time console log viewer.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   Go 1.21 or higher
*   macOS ( Tahoe/darwin ARM64 ) or Linux

### Quick Setup

1.  **Clone & Build**:
    ```bash
    # Build and sign the binaries
    go build -ldflags="-linkmode=external" -o kiwi cmd/kiwi/main.go && codesign -s - -f ./kiwi
    go build -ldflags="-linkmode=external" -o kiwid cmd/kiwid/main.go && codesign -s - -f ./kiwid
    ```

2.  **Start the Kiwi Server Daemon**:
    ```bash
    ./kiwid -addr :8080 -db kiwi.db
    ```

3.  **Deploy a Task**:
    Set up a local `secrets.json` file in your workspace directory (or export env vars) and execute:
    ```bash
    # Create secrets
    echo '{"GITHUB_TOKEN": "real-token-value-here"}' > secrets.json

    # Run loop
    ./kiwi -task "Fix division by zero in Divide()" -file demo_project/math_utils.go -test-cmd "go test ./demo_project/..."
    ```

4.  **Access the Dashboard**:
    Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your web browser.
