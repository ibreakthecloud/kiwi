# Kiwi: The Secure Agentic Control Plane

Kiwi is an enterprise-ready secure execution engine that runs autonomous developer loops (TDD Actor-Critic alignment) in the cloud while pulling required secrets dynamically and securely from the local machine over a reverse tunnel.

With Kiwi, you can trigger complex, long-running agent workflows in the cloud sandbox and **safely close your laptop**. Once a credential (like a GitHub OAuth token or database keys) is resolved, it is cached securely in-memory on the cloud daemon, allowing the loop to continue executing to completion even if your laptop is closed and the tunnel drops.

## High-Level Architecture

    participant CLI as Local CLI Client
    participant Server as Kiwi Cloud Daemon
    participant Sandbox as Cloud Sandbox (Docker Container)

    CLI->>Server: 1. Pack & Sync Codebase (ZIP upload)
    Server->>Sandbox: 2. Extract Workspace & Start Container
    Server->>Server: 3. Spawn Actor-Critic Loop
    CLI->>Server: 4. Open Reverse Tunnel stream (GET /tunnel/{id})
    
    Note over Server, CLI: Initial Handshake
    Server->>CLI: Request Secret Key (e.g. GITHUB_TOKEN)
    CLI-->>Server: POST Secret Value
    Server->>Server: Store Secret in Memory Cache

    Note over CLI: Laptop Closed! (Tunnel Breaks)
    
    loop Loop Execution (Headless)
        Server->>Server: Retrieve GITHUB_TOKEN from Cache
        Server->>Sandbox: Inject Cached Credentials
        Sandbox->>Sandbox: Execute Isolated Test / Build inside Container
    end

    Note over Server: If a NEW un-cached secret is requested:
    Server->>Server: Detect Disconnect, set State to "PAUSED" & Block thread
    Note over CLI: Laptop Reopened! (Resume task)
    CLI->>Server: Resume Task (kiwi -resume -task-id {id})
    Server->>Server: Set Task State back to "RUNNING" & Unblock
```

## Core Features

1.  **Actor-Critic Alignment Loop**: A test-driven development (TDD) controller that iteratively edits code, evaluates compiler/test stdout in the sandbox, and refines fixes.
2.  **Docker Container Sandboxing**: Isolates all untrusted code modification, compilation, and test execution inside dedicated Docker containers (`golang:1.21-alpine`), securing the server host.
3.  **Reverse Credential Tunneling**: Eliminates the need to persist long-lived AWS, GitHub, or GCP API credentials on cloud sandbox hosts.
4.  **Credentials Caching**: Allows developers to close their laptops immediately after the loop starts. The cloud sandbox uses cached credentials to execute the remaining iterations.
5.  **Headless Laptop Pause & Resume**: Complete offline resilience. If an un-cached secret is needed while the laptop is closed, execution statefully pauses and resumes when the laptop is opened.
6.  **Loop Safety & Budgeting**:
    *   **Circuit Breaker**: Detects infinite recursive loop states by tracking duplicate compiler stdout patterns (stops after 3 identical failures).
    *   **Budget Caps**: Sets strict cost controls per task to prevent budget drainage.
7.  **Interactive Kanban Dashboard**: Embedded dark-themed dashboard featuring status cards, live polling, log filters, and a real-time console log viewer.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   Go 1.21 or higher
*   macOS or Linux
*   Docker Desktop (for container sandboxing)

### Quick Setup

1.  **Clone & Build**:
    ```bash
    # Build and sign the binaries
    go build -ldflags="-linkmode=external" -o kiwi cmd/kiwi/main.go && codesign -s - -f ./kiwi
    go build -ldflags="-linkmode=external" -o kiwid cmd/kiwid/main.go && codesign -s - -f ./kiwid
    ```

2.  **Start the Kiwi Server Daemon**:
    Configure the auth token and enable Docker sandboxing:
    ```bash
    export USE_DOCKER="true"
    export KIWI_SERVER_TOKEN="production-secure-token-9999"
    ./kiwid -addr :8080 -db kiwi.db
    ```

3.  **Deploy a Task**:
    Set up a local `secrets.json` file in your workspace directory (or export env vars) and execute:
    ```bash
    # Create secrets
    echo '{"GITHUB_TOKEN": "real-token-value-here"}' > secrets.json

    # Run loop
    ./kiwi -token "production-secure-token-9999" -task "Fix division by zero in Divide()" -file demo_project/math_utils.go -test-cmd "go test ./demo_project/..."
    ```

4.  **Access the Dashboard**:
    Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your web browser.
